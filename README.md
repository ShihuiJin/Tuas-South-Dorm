# Tuas-South-Dorm

This folder includes the code for the Tuas South Dorm project (Estimating transmission dynamics at different intraspatial levels in an institutional outbreak).

Model 1 is the model in which we did not account for impacts of the interventions while model 2 is the model in which we considered the impacts of the interventions.

For each model, there are 3 files: "mcmc" is the file which we used to obtain the posterior samples; "functions" and "functions_rcpp" are the files for the R and cpp functions we used to obtain the likelihoods for Metropolis Hasting sampling.
